# Project Constitution: AI-Powered Todo System

## 1. Core Mandate
This project follows the **Spec-Driven Development (SDD)** methodology. All architectural decisions and implementations must align with the provided specifications.

## 2. Development Principles
* **AI-Native Implementation:** No manual coding is allowed. All source code must be generated by Claude Code or Spec-Kit Plus.
* **Spec-First:** Any change in functionality must first be updated in the Markdown specification files before code generation.
* **Modular Design:** Each phase must maintain clean boundaries to ensure scalability from a console app to a distributed cloud system.

## 3. Tooling & Guardrails
* **Package Management:** Use `uv` for all Python dependency management.
* **Deployment:** Infrastructure must be handled via AI-assisted tools (e.g., kubectl-ai for Kubernetes).
* **Quality Control:** Every feature must be verified through the CLI or Web UI as per the phase requirements.

## 4. Operational Ethics
* The AI agent must prioritize security and efficiency in code generation.
* Manual overrides are strictly prohibited to ensure the integrity of the "Architect-only" workflow.
